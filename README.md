# Summary

An alternative design for Nerdy Gurdy tangents, based on professional instrument shown to me by my professor. They're designed to be used with heat shrinking tubing to further 'sweetening' the sound of melodic strings. They're a little shorter than those designed by Jaap Brand so there is more space for strings to vibrate(to reduce unnecessary buzzing etc.). The single shrinking tube might be not enough - use as many as You think will suit your instrument.
